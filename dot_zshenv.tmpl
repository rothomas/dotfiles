# WARNING: Any changes you make to PATH here will be overwritten by Darwin's
#          /etc/zprofile, which is executed after this. Set up paths as needed
#          here for prerequisites, but expect that you'll need to make the
#          same changes again later. Recommend using your own .zprofile, which
#          runs before your .zshrc.

# Store zsh dotfiles (apart from this one) in a directory instead of HOME
